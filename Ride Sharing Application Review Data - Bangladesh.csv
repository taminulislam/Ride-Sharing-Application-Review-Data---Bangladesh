"Nice step in that ""reserve"" is now available for all ride types. However, it's only still available in the major cities and not in resort areas such as Lake Geneva, WI. Y'all would be surprised how many visitors to the outlying areas would be appreciative of an all-access feature. Can we get a timeline as to when it's system-wide?",TRUE,59,UBER
"It has become one of the worst services. The drivers call up after booking and ask about the destination, and the mode of payment. If the mode of payment is online or the destination is too far away for their liking, they outright cancel it, even after stalling for more than 5 or so minutes. Also, this app doesn't even have a proper customer service nor any option of reviewing the drivers except for a liekert system. I'd rather book a yellow taxi than a Uber these days.

"The app is good at showing the data user the direction of the driver. However, yesterday I was disappointed when ordering a ride. I was ordering the Chap Chap option and at the time, I was forced to give out my payment details such as PayPal, Credit or Debit Card details. The app didn't provide for M-PESA or cash option.

Absolutely ridiculous. I've had this app for a few years now and it's prices from me taking a 15min drive have went from $13-15 all the way to $40-50. And it's worse If you try to schedule an uber at night! The prices skyrocket! I honestly don't get why uber charge so much when their drivers cancel over and over again.

"The app is very good for price comparison to other firms and does provide somewhat a cheaper ride. But on busy periods the same ride can double in price which I find very odd for the same journey. Another is the fact that if I cancel the uber car it charges still, however recently I've found that drivers picking up jobs are then canceling them minutes later for better jobs after you've been sat waiting with no consequence? Very inconsiderate and it should not be allowd once a job is accepted",TRUE,91,SHOHOZ
What was once a company about convenience is now a company where the drivers are looking to game the algorithm. I can't even remember the amount of times I have had to wait anywhere from 30 to 40 minutes in Manhattan for a driver to show up. I've had drivers cancel on a trip when they were less than 100 feet away.

On average it would cost a total of 10 or 11 bucks, and that was for about 2 months straight.

Had the worst experience with the app today. Couldn't find a ride for over 40 minutes. Just kept hopping around for the app to say they couldn't find a ride.

Riders are regularly accepting rides when completing trips which would result in a wait time of 30 mins . 20 for their current ride and around 10 for you which is not my issue. The issue is is that after waiting the 20 mins for them to drop of their current ride they cancel on you. And then you have to wait around 20 mins for the second time and hope it doesn't happen again. I feel like drivers should be held accountable for this when accepting rides . You can't report cancellations either.,TRUE,92,UBER
Wish I could give them no stars...Uber ride is really stupid because the drivers be driving in circles around the pick up location and the Uber eats part of this app is retarded....

I have some great memories with pathao ride. One day I got to pay only 18tk charge for riding by bike from Narinda to Dhanmondi Zigatola. Fascinating though I enjoyed those times!,TRUE,32,PATHAO
Absolutely horrible service. Their app is really big and will exploit every chance to rob your money. Try Uber. At least they are more professional and won't bug 20 times a day with useless notification.,TRUE,35,SHOHOZ
Its not a good but its our habbit,TRUE,8,OBHAI

Now a days they charge different price, when we book, it show one price and price gets high when we are in our destination😠.

Hit or Miss service. Either it’s all OK or I may experience the worst. Enough for ruining my day.,TRUE,19,OBHAI
"The app doesn't show optimized route, it shows a longer / traffic densed route and give an extended fare. Also it picks biker from distant points and takes too much time to search for bike.",TRUE,34,PATHAO
There are some basic problems: (1) If GPS location changes from selected pickup point to reach the rider in suitable location the pickup point doesn't change. It calculate the fare from initial position. (2) If I use shortcut the fare remains same as calculated before ride confirmation. (3) Two locations one is longer than other. But found that shortest distance charges more than long distance. This app should be more intelligent.,TRUE,71,SHOHOZ
The app is good but they don’t respond to emails and other stuff.I've tried to open a merchant account for courier 6th August. It was supposed to take 2 business days for verification. Now It's 17th August still no response. I've also mailed and reported this issue. Never got a response. If I could rate for the app I would've given 5 star. But when you put it all together I don't think I can rate this above 1 star.,TRUE,80,SHOHOZ
"For the last few days I have been suffering from an annoying issue related to location search. The app continues to search the location while I use wi-fi but it never finds the location the current location and I have to abandon using the app for that time. And now I am irritated with the problematic issue extremely. Therefore, can you look up the issue of location finding error of the app and solve it as soon as possible so that my previous experience of using the Pathao service restores again. Thank you.",TRUE,93,OBHAI
"I had to pay almost double than the amount Pathao showed initially in last 4 rides for their ""GPS"" problem. I have complained every time, and Pathao only responded by giving some ""discount"", and nothing changed, whenever I used it, I faced the same ""GPS problem"" again. After calling helpline I got suggestion to contact the page. But the page is not responsive. This is disappointing!",TRUE,66,SHOHOZ
"ordering food on pathao is a hilarious experience to me. most of the time my order get cancelled. couldn't even know whether I would find a foodman or not. moreover, in case of sharing ride, I have to pay too much extra money on base fare (charged on the duration of total time of the ride). uber charges it too, but not so big amount of money is added there. thank you.",TRUE,72,PATHAO
"This app steals user data. It asks for location access in app and then the android menu asks for sms and contacts access as well. It's just outrageous. I'm feeling extremely bad thinking that all of my contacts and sms are saved on their server right at this moment. Nonetheless, I've uninstalled this app. If the developers are reading this comment then I have only one thing to say. What you did in the app was the worst thing you can do with a consumer. You just lost our trust.",TRUE,90,OBHAI
"Uninstalled it, the service is getting worse day by day. Drivers are reckless in riding. Few days before hanged my request for about one hour, i even complained to pathao about this issue, but they are unaware. Moreover i saw, they are stealing customers personal information like sms, contacts, apps details, my every update over phone. So, i think its better to uninstall Pathao, because there are so many ride sharing service now offering better than pathao, and no need to worry about uncertainty and insecurity. Not recommending to anyone.",TRUE,90,SHOHOZ
"I had ordered the food and it showed for 3 hours that the order was being processed, in this time I repeatedly called the ""Foodman"" but they dont even pick up and at 10 15 pm they finally picked up and was saying that there was no order this app is totally useless and caused a lot of havoc in my life. If there was a way to give 0 stars I would have given that",TRUE,76,UBER
"I registered to check what the app is about. I had to key in my mobile number and I instantly regretted. They kept sending me ads in SMS. There is no options in settings where I can disable this feature. Uninstalled the app, SMS ads still kept coming. I wrote email to support for removal. As a last resort I called in their support and talked to human to remove me. Nothing has worked so far. Maybe I should sue or something legally?",TRUE,83,OBHAI
"Use your app today for a long time. But today I have changed thinking thoughts in the evening and I will not use it. Service is good when I am satisfied with it. While riding in the evening today, my offer was offered by Ride Bill 80৳ on the phone because of my offer. At the end of the ride, Rider said 140 ৳. 60 It is better not to seek service with excess.

I am a regular pathao user. As pathao is promotioning the digital payment but the drivers are very unwilling to it. The always phoned and asked in which way the payment will given.

I was a fan of Sohoz foods untill the recent app update. The new app is too much buggy. It struggles every time I try to scroll through the restaurants or food menu.

bring back cash payment system. removing cash paymnt was the biggest mistake.,FALSE,12,Obhai
"Very poor service! Don't provide enough vehicle , sometimes if we get connected one luckily driver refused to go and cancelled. Very very poor service!",FALSE,24,Obhai
I believe this is my second review. Recently I decided to use obhai and pay with bkash. When I reached my destination I was having a hard time paying the fare because the net was poor. It was really frustrating. Why on earth would OBhai remove the cash option for payment? They should make all the payment options available to the customers.,FALSE,62,Obhai

"Last night when I tried to book a ride, I found out that I couldn’t pay in cash. I didn't have access to a digital payment system at that moment and the bkash payment has to be done before the ride!! Moreover, the app doesn't allow any other bank cards except Eastern bank! Do you guys set strategies without thinking? Is digital payment method suitable in a country like ours? Such a stupid step! I'm done with OBhai.",FALSE,78,Obhai

Poor service now a days. Can't connect to drivers and the drivers ask for destination and cancel frequently.,FALSE,18,Obhai
Very bad experience. Don't have enough rides to provide and moreover they keep cancelling. We use this app to get convenience but if we can't avail facility then what's the use!!!! Even if i avail one cng they demand too much fare. Their system also works poorly. I booked one cng to pay through bkash. Though the ride was over I couldn't find the payment option. Moreover the rider demanded to pay him personally. I was harrassed. Very very disappointing,FALSE,80,Obhai
Terrible app. Takes a lot of time to assign a driver. Sometimes there's no response at all even after waiting for several minutes. Then there's this thing called obhai miles; i didnt have any of this so i wasn’t able to get a driver because i needed sufficient amount of it! I tried to change the payment method but it didn't work! Just terrible.,FALSE,64,Obhai
"I have installed it 3 times and couldn't use even once! It keeps lagging. I have never got a obon drive even though I tried several times. They are always unavailable.

Good luck with this kind of service",FALSE,63,Obhai

very poor application. keeps searching for vehicles minutes after minutes while other apps find almost instantly!!! The CNG taxi drivers also don't know where they are going through they are shown the destination place in the map. After mentioning the destination place they deny to go!!!,FALSE,46,Obhai
I don't find usefulness of your service anymore. I don't know how and why you guys started competition with Uber without knowing how the service is provided. This app has no drivers. Just a showpiece and boring notification sender. . . . Reply: I don't want to fill any forms. Just ask your Customer Relationship Department about the availability and service of your product. I bet they know about this very well.,FALSE,69,Obhai
"Could give you ★★★, but your app become worst after recent updates. It closed automatically after touching 'Ride Now' section. And always opted for new promo codes!! Seriously??

Hope you will consider all of them.",FALSE,67,Obhai

"I have been using this app since it first came out. But recently its showing too much excess fare where as it was quite reasonable. If I contact a cng manually if thee fare is BDT 300, Obhai shows it to be BDT 400. Which is actually the fare of Pathao Car Ride. I don't see any reason to continue using this app if I can save by contacting drivers manually. Very disappointed.",FALSE,73,Obhai
"Works well, but fare pricing is almost at Uber rate. Also, please make the font bigger, difficult to read; have to change resolution of phone screen in order to read properly (then have to change screen resolution back, hassle)",FALSE,39,Obhai
"Pathetic Experience. This App used to be great, almost replaced UBER. But now they introduced digital payment system and drivers won't accept digital payments and hence if you book a car or CNG, there's a big chance that after the trip, the driver will have a big quarrel with you. Very unfortunate to face such service suddenly.",FALSE,57,Obhai

Driver assigning management is very bad. they assign driver exactly from middle point of taking and dropping location for which most of the drive refuse to go and request to cancel ride. and it effects on us. we are block for book new driver. poor service,FALSE,46,Obhai
so slow app! it's hilarious to wait for the app opening! you should work on the app! cause we don't have that much time for one ride! we all are in hurry! and everyone wants everything faster! you app isn't upto that level! and it's too much slow to show how much we have to pay! and we have to wait longer tym for the amount to appear! i think you should work on it! than we can use it properly!,FALSE,81,Obhai

Their service was good only for my first ride but now? The drivers keep cancelling rides. So disappointing :) You would need obhaimiles to pay cash for a ride. Otherways you have to go through bkash payment. What if I don't have online payment app? What if I wanna pay cash? What if I wanna tip the driver?

In the earlier I requested for car in the rush hour and no one accepted it.. I tried in various ride sharing apps but no one response.. Than tried in OBHAI G and same things happened.

Very poor app. The app gets hanged quite often. I appreciate the service they are offering. undoubtedly female bike rider & cng service r unique then any other ride sharing app. Bt number of the rider is very minimum. so can't count on the service. if one's get lucky he/she'll get a ride in desired time. also cng drivers are very impatient in waiting. if I've sceduled a ride for a certain time I'd want to start my ride at that time not immediately after he reaches. also I can't use OBHAI miles.,FALSE,94,Obhai

Moto ride fare is too much high compare to uber moto. If you don't reduce you moto ride fare you cant able to survive in this race. I don't use this app only because of it's high fare.

One more thing you should give more discount coupon in bike ride rather than CNG ride which no one used too many. Thanks.,FALSE,78,Obhai
